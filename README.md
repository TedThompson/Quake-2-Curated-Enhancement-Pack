## Featuring:
* Textures and Models from Yagami's server
* HUD Graphics from Knightmare Qauke 2

* Bots from Mr. Elusive (Gladiator Bot)
* Some overlooked textures from me forming a complete set covering the base game and expansions

## Installation:
1. Install [Yamagi Quake 2](https://www.yamagi.org/quake2/) following [their directions](https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2/blob/ba2fc77ee811da3751c9f61dceff22ccaa07003a/doc/020_installation.md) until you have a working Quake 2 game.
