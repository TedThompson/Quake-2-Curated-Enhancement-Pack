Description:    A curated set of textures and files to more or less 
                create the re-master we deserve and crave,
                but seems we will never get.
                
                Upscales all textures including HUD textures,
                provides all the original music for the base game 
                and both expansion packs, and adds bots for offline
                deathmatch play (like the Q1 re-release got).
                
                Intended for use with Yagami Quake2, but should
                work for almost any mainstream port with png and
                tga support.
