pak-models.pk3 and pak-textures.pk3 were renamed from models.zip and textures.zip downloaded from
https://deponie.yamagi.org/quake2/texturepack/

pak-env.pk3 files came from 
https://github.com/Calinou/quake2-neural-upscale

All other pak-*.pk3 files have credits within the file.

NOTE: A pk3 is a renamed ZIP file and can be opened like any other zip file.
