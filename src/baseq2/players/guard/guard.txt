AUTHOR INFO
-----------
Vince (V.K.)
Known on Alphalink Quake and Quake 2 as Ryuujin, leader of clan Orochi.
I need a better nick (it has no relation to Street Fighter)

TYPE OF MOD 
-----------
DLL      : No
Sound    : No (Tried it; didn't work)
MDL      : Yes
Maps     : No
Graphics : No

FORMAT
------
MD2 format, used Q2 Modeller 8.2 and 8.3.

INSTALLATION
------------
This is a self extracting archive. 
Simply run it in your BASEQ2/PLAYERS directory.

NOTES
-----
The original Q2 enemy skins have been included.
The weapon model is now so tiny you cannot see it.
This way it looks as if the model is firing from their built-in weapon.

BUGS
----
Causes "No such frame 46" or "No such frame 53" messages sometimes.
Seems to have something to do with point-blank BFG discharges.

COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS
----------------------
The original model and animations are by Id software. 
Feel free to create skins for it, just acknowledge that I 
painstakingly converted the model for plug-in player model use.
Do not try to copy this and claim you created it.

Have fun,
V.K. '98
