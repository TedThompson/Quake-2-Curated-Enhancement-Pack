Sound Pack for the Guard model

INFO ON THIS HERE STUFF
All sounds in this sound pack are taken from Quake2's ID0.PAK file. Just
nicked the original guard sounds and renamed them. No big deal to it.

INSTALLING IT? HOW?
Place all the files from this archive into the directory of the Guard
model. (QUAKE2\BASEQ2\PLAYERS\GUARD, probably)

WHAT ABOUT COPYRIGHT/PERMISSIONS?
The Copyright belongs entirely to ID Software. I didn't make these sounds,
I just rearranged them. Other than that....Whatever. I made this for my
own enjoyment, do what you want with it. I'm probably not going to answer
any email concerning this soundpack either, so don't bother.
